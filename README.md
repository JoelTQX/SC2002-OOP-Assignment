# Hospital Management System (HMS)
## Objective
The primary goal of this assignment is to:

- Apply Object-Oriented (OO) concepts in a real-world application.
- Design and develop an OO application using Java.
- Collaboratively work as a team to achieve a common objective.
- Gain practical experience with Java as an object-oriented programming language.
  
## Project Overview
This project is a Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to automate hospital operations, including patient management, appointment scheduling, staff management, and inventory handling. The HMS is a command-line Java application that allows different users to manage hospital functions efficiently.

## Features
- Secure Login: Role-based access for patients, doctors, pharmacists, and administrators.
- Patient Management: View medical records, book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
- Doctor Management: Manage patient records, update diagnoses and prescriptions, manage appointment schedules.
- Pharmacy Management: Manage prescriptions and update inventory.
- Admin Management: Manage hospital staff, appointments, and medicine inventory.
  
## User Roles & Capabilities

- Doctor: View/update patient medical records, manage availability, and log appointment outcomes.
- Pharmacist: Fulfill prescriptions, update inventory, and request restocks.
- Administrator: Manage staff, appointments, and medication inventory.
  
## Development
- Language: Java
- Tools: Preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse), JDK
- Interface: Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Data: Stored in user-created files (no external databases or JSON/XML formats)

## Future Enhancements
Add more features to improve user experience and system performance.
Implement additional functionalities like automated billing or staff performance analytics.

## Report
This project includes:

- UML Class Diagram
- Detailed design considerations and OO concepts applied
- Reflection on development challenges and improvements
